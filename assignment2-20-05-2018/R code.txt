#Problem 1
#The null hypothesis is µ = 15000. 
#Begin with computing the test statistic.
xbar = 14900
#sample mean
mu0 = 15000 
# hypothesized value 
sigma = 110 # population standard deviation
n = 40 # sample size 
z = (xbar-mu0)/(sigma/sqrt(n)) 
z # test statistic 
#5.749
pnorm(-5.749596)
#The critical value at .05 significance level
alpha = .05 
z.alpha = qnorm(1-alpha) 
-z.alpha # critical value [1] -1.6449
#The test statistic -4.5644 is less than the critical value of
#-1.6449. Hence, at .05 significance level, 
#we reject the claim that mean life of a fan is above 15,000 hours.

#Problem 2:
#######
#The null hypothesis is that µ = 4. 
#We begin with computing the test statistic.
xbar1=4.2 # sample mean
mu01=4 # Hypothezied Value
sigma1=0.50 # population standard deviation
n1=70 # sample size
z1=(xbar1-mu01)/(sigma1/sqrt(n1))
z1
#We apply the pnorm function to compute the
#upper tail p-value of the test statistic. 
#As it turns out to be less than the .05 significance level, 
#we reject the null hypothesis that µ = 4.

###Or#######
alpha=0.05
z.alpha = qnorm(1-alpha)
z.alpha
#The test statistic 3.344 is greater than the critical value of
#1.6449. Hence, at .05 significance level, we reject the 
#claim that there is at most 4 grams of saturated fat in a chocolate.

## Problem 3 ###

#The null hypothesis is that µ = 15.4. 
xbar = 14.6 # sample mean
mu0 = 15.4 # hypothesized value
sigma = 2.5 # population standard deviation
n = 35 # sample size
z = (xbar-mu0)/(sigma/sqrt(n))

alpha = .05 
z.half.alpha = qnorm(1-alpha/2) 
c(-z.half.alpha, z.half.alpha)

##The test statistic -1.8931 lies between the critical values
##-1.9600 and 1.9600. 
##Hence, at .05 significance level, 
##we do not reject the null hypothesis 
##that the mean penguin weight does not differ from last year.

##
##We apply the pnorm function to compute the two-tailed p-value
##of the test statistic. 
##It doubles the lower tail p-value as the 
##sample mean is less than the hypothesized value.
##Since it turns out to be greater than the .05 significance level, 
##we do not reject the null hypothesis that µ = 15.4.

##Positive residuals are in blue. Positive values in cells
##specify an attraction (positive association)
